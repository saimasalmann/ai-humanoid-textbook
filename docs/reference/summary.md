## Safety Disclaimer

This textbook emphasizes safety-first development practices throughout all modules. When implementing the concepts covered in physical robotic systems, always follow proper safety protocols, maintain emergency stop capabilities, and test extensively in simulation before physical deployment. Physical robots can cause harm if operated without proper safety measures.
