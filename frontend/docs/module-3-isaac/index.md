- Integrate AI models with robotic control systems

## Introduction
Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on the NVIDIA Isaac platform for developing AI-powered robotic systems. You'll learn how to integrate perception, planning, and control systems to create intelligent robots capable of autonomous operation in complex environments.

The NVIDIA Isaac platform combines simulation, perception, navigation, and manipulation capabilities with GPU-accelerated computing. This module will teach you how to leverage these capabilities to build advanced AI-driven robotic systems.

## Isaac Platform Overview
The Isaac platform consists of several key components that work together to enable AI-powered robotics:

1. **Isaac Sim**: High-fidelity physics simulation environment built on NVIDIA Omniverse
2. **Isaac ROS**: GPU-accelerated perception and navigation algorithms
3. **Isaac Apps**: Complete robot applications and reference implementations
4. **Isaac Lab**: Framework for robot learning and simulation
5. **Omniverse**: Foundation for 3D collaboration and simulation

These components enable rapid development and deployment of AI-powered robotic systems.

## Module Structure
This module is organized into the following chapters:
1. **Isaac Overview**: Understanding the Isaac platform architecture and components
2. **Perception Stack**: Building AI-powered perception systems
3. **RL Navigation**: Using reinforcement learning for robot navigation

Each chapter builds on the previous one, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of AI-powered robotics using Isaac.

## Integration with Other Modules
This module builds upon the foundations established in:
- Module 1: ROS 2 fundamentals for communication and control
- Module 2: Simulation environments for testing and development

The concepts learned here will be essential for the capstone project and Module 4: Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Summary
Module 3 introduces you to the NVIDIA Isaac platform for developing AI-powered robotic systems. Understanding Isaac's capabilities for perception, navigation, and simulation will enable you to create intelligent robots that can operate autonomously in complex environments. The GPU-accelerated algorithms and high-fidelity simulation capabilities of Isaac make it ideal for developing advanced robotic applications.

## Safety Disclaimer
When using NVIDIA Isaac for robotics development, ensure that your hardware meets the minimum requirements to avoid system instability. GPU-intensive operations can generate significant heat and consume substantial power. Monitor system temperatures and power consumption during intensive simulations. Always follow NVIDIA's hardware safety guidelines when operating GPU-accelerated systems.
