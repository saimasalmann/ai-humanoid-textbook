# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to our comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This blog will serve as a companion to our detailed textbook content, providing updates, insights, and additional resources for students and researchers in the field of embodied intelligence.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is designed to bridge the gap between digital AI and physical robotics, covering essential topics from ROS 2 fundamentals to Vision-Language-Action systems. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding how AI can be embodied in physical systems.

## What to Expect

In future posts, we'll cover:

- Deep dives into specific robotics concepts
- Tutorials and practical examples
- Updates on the latest research in humanoid robotics
- Case studies from real-world implementations
- Student projects and showcases

Stay tuned for more content as we continue to develop this resource for the robotics community!
