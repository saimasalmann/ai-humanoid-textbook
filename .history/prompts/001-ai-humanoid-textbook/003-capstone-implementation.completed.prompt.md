## Prompt

Complete the capstone implementation for the autonomous conversational humanoid robot project, including all necessary documentation, setup guides, and troubleshooting resources.

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the capstone implementation for the autonomous conversational humanoid robot project. All components have been implemented including:
- Complete capstone project documentation (overview, architecture, implementation, evaluation)
- Vision-Language-Action troubleshooting guide
- Isaac Sim setup guide
- All safety and ethical considerations addressed throughout the system

The implementation follows all constitutional principles with technical accuracy, conceptual clarity, engineering focus, reproducibility, AI-native workflow, ethical development, and open-source first approach. The system integrates all four modules (ROS 2, Simulation, Isaac AI, VLA) into a unified autonomous conversational humanoid robot system.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete capstone project for autonomous conversational humanoid robot implemented
- 🧪 Tests: All system components validated and integrated successfully
- 📁 Files: Created comprehensive capstone documentation and supplementary guides
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for final review and deployment
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated all textbook concepts into a cohesive capstone project

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all components successfully implemented
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all requirements satisfied
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Final review and deployment
