# Understanding ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robotics

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the backbone for most modern robotics applications, including humanoid robots. In this post, we'll explore why ROS 2 is crucial for Physical AI systems.

## Why ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics?

ROS 2 provides the middleware necessary for complex humanoid robots to coordinate multiple sensors, actuators, and AI systems. Its distributed architecture allows different components of a humanoid robot to run independently while communicating seamlessly.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform specific functions
- **Topics**: Communication channels for data streams
- **Services**: Request/response communication patterns
- **Actions**: Goal-oriented communication with feedback

## Practical Applications

In humanoid robotics, ROS 2 enables:

- Sensor fusion from cameras, IMUs, and other sensors
- Coordination between perception and action systems
- Real-time control loops for stable locomotion
- Integration of AI models for decision making

These concepts form the foundation of how modern humanoid robots operate and interact with their environment.
