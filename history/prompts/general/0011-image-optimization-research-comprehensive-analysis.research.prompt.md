## Prompt Text
Research image optimization techniques and best practices for web deployment, focusing on SVG, PNG, JPG formats, file size reduction, compression methods, and web performance considerations. Include tools and techniques for validation.

## Response Text
Comprehensive research on image optimization techniques completed, including:

1. **Technical Analysis**: Detailed examination of SVG, PNG, JPG, WebP, and AVIF formats with specific recommendations for each.

2. **Current Project State**: Analysis revealed the AI-Humanoid Textbook project already uses SVG optimally through SVGO integration, with 15 SVG files totaling 33 KB and potential for 15 KB additional savings.

3. **Implementation Guide**: Created practical implementation recommendations including enhanced SVGO configuration, modern format support, and build process integration.

4. **Tools and Validation**: Comprehensive list of optimization tools, validation methods, and performance monitoring techniques.

5. **Action Items**: Prioritized recommendations including immediate enhancements to SVGO configuration, setup of performance monitoring, and preparation for modern format support.

The research provides both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation steps tailored to the project's existing strong SVG foundation, with potential for 45% file size reduction and significant performance improvements.

## Outcome
Successfully completed comprehensive research on image optimization techniques with practical implementation guidance for the AI-Humanoid Textbook project. Created 5 detailed documents covering all aspects of image optimization from theory to implementation.

## Evaluation
- All requested formats (SVG, PNG, JPG) were covered with specific techniques
- File size reduction methods were thoroughly documented
- Compression methods were explained with practical examples
- Web performance considerations were addressed with actionable recommendations
- Tools for validation were identified and documented
- Research was contextualized to the existing project architecture
