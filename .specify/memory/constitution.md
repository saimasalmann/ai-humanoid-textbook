# AI-native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics for Academic and Industry Learners Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy
All factual claims MUST be verified through primary and authoritative sources.

### II. Conceptual Clarity
Content MUST be clear and accessible for undergraduate to early postgraduate students.

### III. Engineering Focus
Explanations MUST prioritize engineering perspectives with real-world robotics context.

### IV. Reproducibility
All experiments, simulations, and algorithms MUST be reproducible.

### V. AI-Native Workflow
Development MUST adhere to an AI-native workflow using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.

### VI. Ethical Development
All content and examples MUST promote ethical, safe, and responsible AI and robotics development.

### VII. Open-Source First
An open-source-first mindset MUST guide all development and content creation.

## Key Standards

*   All factual claims MUST be verifiable and source-backed.
*   Citation format: IEEE style (preferred for engineering).
*   Source types:
    *   Minimum 60% peer-reviewed research papers.
    *   Remaining sources may include official documentation (ROS, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Boston Dynamics, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   No hallucinated references allowed.
*   Code MUST be:
    *   Reproducible.
    *   Commented.
    *   Version-controlled.
*   Diagrams MUST be:
    *   AI-generated or open-licensed.
    *   Properly labeled.
*   Writing clarity:
    *   Flesch-Kincaid grade 9–12.
    *   Avoid unnecessary jargon without explanation.

## Technical Constraints

*   Book framework: Docusaurus.
*   Hosting: GitHub Pages.
*   Language: English.
*   Structure:
    *   Modular chapters.
    *   Each chapter MUST include:
        *   Learning objectives.
        *   Key concepts.
        *   Diagrams.
        *   Code examples.
        *   Exercises.
        *   Summary.

## Compliance & Integrity

*   Zero tolerance for plagiarism.
*   All reused text MUST be rewritten.
*   AI-generated code MUST be validated.
*   Dangerous robotics instructions MUST include safety disclaimers.
*   No weaponized robotics content allowed.

## Success Criteria

*   Fully deployable Docusaurus site on GitHub Pages.
*   All content source-verified.
*   Zero plagiarism report.
*   Fully working code examples.
*   Clear educational flow from beginner to advanced.
*   Peer-review ready academic quality.
*   Suitable for university-level Physical AI & Robotics courses.
## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other development practices; Amendments require a documented proposal, team approval, and a clear migration plan; All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.
